2. Use the buttons to input numbers and select operations.
3. Press the equals button to see the result.
4. Use the clear button to reset the calculator.

## Additional Notes

This project is a great starting point for learning about web development and can be expanded with more advanced features such as scientific calculations, history of calculations, or a more sophisticated user interface.
